# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m *Md. Rifat Hasan Jihan*
I'm a graduate from Khulna University of Engineering and Technology in Mechanical Engineering, currently transitioning into the field of software development. Over time, Iâ€™ve built a strong foundation in programming with languages like C, C++, and Java. Iâ€™ve also worked with frameworks such as Spring, Spring Boot, and Thymeleaf, and I have experience with databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL. On the front end, I have hands-on experience using HTML, CSS, JavaScript to build functional user interfaces.

My engineering background has taught me how to approach problems analytically and think in a systematic manner. These skills that I now apply to writing clean, scalable code and building efficient applications. Iâ€™m particularly drawn to backend development, and Iâ€™m excited to join a team where I can continue growing, contributing, and solving meaningful challenges through technology.
